### Abstract

**BACKGROUND**   
The opioid crisis is one of the main challenges facing public health. In San Joaquin County, California, the issue has escalated due to increased prescribed opioids and easy access to street drugs. This paper evaluates the interventions implemented by the San Joaquin County Opioid Safety Coalition (OSC) and identifies current or future challenges.

**METHODS**  
This qualitative study assessed the effectiveness of interventions implemented by the OSC in San Joaquin County through key informant interviews from June 2019 to August 2019. Twelve OSC members were initially selected based on expertise, including public health officials, policymakers, and law enforcement personnel. Semi-structured interviews explored participants’ roles, perceptions of opioid challenges, familiarity with OSC strategies, and barriers encountered. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Data were categorized into three main themes: (1) the significance of the opioid epidemic, (2) evaluation of OSC’s interventions, and (3) limitations and future challenges.

**RESULTS**  
Ten out of twelve participants completed interviews lasting approximately 30 minutes each. Participants overwhelmingly recognized the severity of the opioid crisis in San Joaquin County, emphasizing the rise of fentanyl-related overdoses, particularly among individuals aged 25 to 64. OSC interventions—including public education campaigns, naloxone distribution, and prescriber training—were highlighted as critical yet insufficient to overcome persistent barriers. Key limitations identified were inadequate financial resources, community resistance to naloxone use, limited stakeholder cooperation, and restricted access to addiction treatment. Furthermore, stigma associated with opioid addiction posed significant challenges, while hesitancy among law enforcement personnel to administer naloxone emphasized the need for clearer policies and expanded training programs.

**CONCLUSION**  
The opioid epidemic remains critical in San Joaquin County despite significant interventions by the Opioid Safety Coalition. Future management requires increased community engagement, targeted training for law enforcement, expanded addiction treatment accessibility, and sustained funding to overcome persistent barriers and reduce opioid-related morbidity and mortality in the region.


### Introduction

Over the last decade, opioid overuse has been considered one of the top public health crises in the United States, contributing to high morbidity and premature mortality. The issue arose in the 1990s, during the first peak wave of highly prescribed opioids, leading to deaths that continued over the years.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">1 </sup> According to the 2024 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the nationwide death toll related to opioids was 89,740.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">2 </sup> In California, almost 7,847 fatalities were attributed to opioid abuse, including 191 deaths recorded in San Joaquin County alone.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">3 </sup> The disproportionate demographic distribution signals an urgent need to implement interventions that target certain age groups. Not all prescribed opioids lead to addiction; however, addiction rates are much higher in states where the issue has become prolific and more deadly with the introduction of highly concentrated synthetic opioids like fentanyl.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">4 </sup> A great portion of these prescriptions were likely issued to recurring patients, yet opioid prescriptions remained prevalent in San Joaquin County. To address this acute epidemic, many community-based programs, first responder training, and law enforcement initiatives have been conducted. A coordinated, collaborative approach may increase the effectiveness of public health interventions.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">5 </sup>

#### Statewide Standing Order for Naloxone

In 2017, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued a statewide order to help control opioid abuse by widely distributing naloxone to facilitate overdose reversal. This initiative led to the launch of training programs and instructional videos targeting law enforcement personnel and first responders.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">6,7 </sup> 

In 2018, the Naloxone Distribution Project (NDP), supported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), distributed naloxone doses throughout California. San Joaquin County Public Health Services receives naloxone from DHCS and distributes it to registered organizations upon request.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">7,8 </sup> Naloxone is effective for opioid overdoses, but personnel responsible for its administration often question whether their training sufficiently covers the technical aspect of its usage and the recognition of the signs and symptoms of overdose.

#### The Opioid Safety Coalition

In 2018, San Joaquin County Public Health Services formed the Opioid Safety Coalition (OSC), supported by local organizations including Sutter Health. The coalition brings together stakeholders, policymakers, law enforcement, first responders, and community partners. OSC’s three main intervention strategies are Education and Outreach, Prescriber and Pharmacy Education, and Overdose Prevention and Medication-Assisted Treatment.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">6,7 </sup> The main initiatives of the OSC’s strategic plan are to increase local community awareness about the opioid crisis, call for prescriber training, and expand the naloxone distribution project. The aim of this survey is to define the impact of the epidemic, OSC’s interventions, and the challenges facing it.


### Methods

This study consisted of a qualitative research approach to assess the impact of OSC’s interventions on addressing the opioid crisis in San Joaquin County. The study conducted key informant interviews where twelve members were initially selected from a total of 40 OSC members, based on their expertise and knowledge of the OSC’s strategic plan. These experts include public health professionals, policy-makers, and law enforcement personnel. The study included ten responders as two of the participants did not finish the entire call interview. Semi-structured phone interviews, which lasted 30 minutes, were conducted with the participants' consent. The participants were informed of the nature of the call, the recording process, and their right to terminate the call at any time. The interview began by exploring the participant's role, the perception of the opioid challenges, the knowledge of the OSC’s intervention plan, and any barriers encountered. The study implemented a thematic analysis, and the data were categorized into three main themes: (1) the significance of the opioid epidemic, (2) the evaluation of OSC’s efforts, and (3) the limitations and future challenges.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">9 </sup> Ethical approval was obtained from the University of San Francisco Ethics Committee and the San Joaquin Department of Public Health. The data collected according to confidentiality and ethical standards.

### Results

Majority of participants (70%) acknowledged the severity of the opioid crisis in San Joaquin, largely attributing it to the rise in Fentanyl-related overdoses. Meanwhile, 50% viewed opioids as a complex public health issue, though opinions varied on the extent of the problem. Among those working closely with the homeless population (30%), there was a strong emphasis on prioritizing life-saving efforts and preventing deaths from over-prescribed opioids. In contrast, participants in medical and behavioral health fields saw the epidemic as manageable, citing recent data from the California Opioid Overdose Surveillance Dashboard to support their view.<sup style="color:#44A6B2;">10 </sup> 

In addition, 70% of the participants emphasized the importance of the OSC interventions to reduce the opioid crisis in the county, including the public education campaign, the health promotion through billboards, the naloxone distribution kits, and the prescriber training programs. However, the OSC efforts were a significant approach to managing the crisis. Despite the work done, OSC still face major challenges. Limitations still exist and these include lack of financial resources, resistance to the adoption of naloxone among the local community, cooperation of stakeholders, and lack of access to treatment for most rehabilitation centers. Participants expressed their concerns regarding the addiction stigma and the difficulty of addressing it among certain communities. The study showed that some law enforcement officers hesitate to carry or administer naloxone due to perceived liability issues, suggesting the need to escalate the naloxone training program and policy clarification.


### Discussion

The findings highlight both the success and the limitations of the current OSC’s opioid prevention efforts in San Joaquin County. Community awareness, public education, prescriber training, and naloxone distribution have to a greater extent resulted in addressing the opioid crisis in the county. Nevertheless, there are still obstacles that need to be resolved, like insufficient funding, addiction stigma in the community, and affordability of treatments. The data stated the demographic weakness among certain ages, suggesting the interventions may target the community’s subgroups (Figure 1).<sup>10</sup> Opioid-related deaths occur across multiple age groups, but they are especially common among adults between the ages of 25 and 69. These age groups represents a significant portion of the working-age population, highlighting the broad impact of the opioid crisis on families, communities, and the workforce. The data suggests that opioid misuse is not limited to any one demographic stratum, but rather affects people in their prime years of productivity and responsibility, making it a major public health concern.<sup>10</sup>

More initiatives should be designed to reach people at risk and provide them with the help that might be needed. There is an urgent need to focus on public education and to address the community addiction stigma by reinforcing all the efforts to facilitate treatment-seeking behaviors and destigmatize the addiction. In addition, law enforcement hesitated to administer naloxone due to a lack of clear policy and guidelines. To address this barrier, training programs should be implemented, and policymakers should be called upon to establish clear initiatives for the law enforcement regarding naloxone administration as first responders in cases of overdose emergencies.  
The financial constraints restrict OSC’s efforts to address the crisis. Securing more funds and increasing resources will improve and maintain the OSC interventions and implement its strategic plan. The cost of addiction treatment is unaffordable for many individuals,reduction of payment plans provided by health insurance and public funding initiatives to support post-addiction treatment such as rehabilitation centers. The opioid crisis in San Joaquin County requires continuous efforts from multi-disciplinary organizations. Although the OSC works to make interventions to overcome the challenges related to lack of funds, the community addiction culture stigma, and the addiction subgroup disparities, more success hinges on improving public awareness of the problem, sustained financial resources, and training of first responders and law enforcement personnel. This can be achieved through a coordinated, evidence-based strategic plan that will focus on addressing the crisis and reducing opioid morbidity and mortality in the county.
